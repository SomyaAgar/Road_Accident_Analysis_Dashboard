# Road Accident Analysis Dashboard – Power BI
This project features an interactive dashboard built with Microsoft Power BI to analyze road accident data from the years 2021 and 2022. The dashboard provides an in-depth overview of total accidents and casualties, accident severity, and year-on-year (YoY) trends. It also uncovers insights based on road types, geographical areas, time of day, weather conditions, and road surfaces where these incidents occurred.

## Project Highlights
- Designed a dynamic Power BI dashboard comparing road accident data between 2021 (previous year) and 2022 (current year).
- Integrated advanced filters, slicers, and drill-down capabilities to support user-driven analysis.
- Conducted data cleaning, transformation, and established data relationships to develop a robust data model.
- Created custom measures and calculated columns using DAX to derive YoY changes, YTD metrics, and category-wise aggregations.
- Utilized a range of visualizations, including:
    - Area charts
    - Donut charts
    - Stacked bar charts
    - Geo-location maps
    - Image imports
    - Map slicers (e.g., weather conditions and road surface types)

## Primary KPIs :
- **Total Casualties and Total Accidents (2022 vs 2021)**
- **Casualties by Accident Severity with YoY growth**
- **Casualties by Vehicle Type (2022)**

## Key Insights
- Primary stakeholders include the Ministry of Transport, Road Transport Department, Police, Emergency Services, Traffic Management Agencies, Media, and the Public.
- Casualties decreased by 11.9% in 2022 compared to 2021.
- Accidents dropped by 11.7%, with 114.4K incidents reported in 2022.
- Reductions observed in:
    - Fatal casualties: 33.3% 
    - Serious casualties: 16.2%
    - Slight casualties: 10.6%
- This improvement suggests better traffic management, infrastructure upgrades, and increased public awareness.
- Cars and vans were involved in the highest number of casualties, followed by motorcycles.
- Winter months saw more casualties, primarily due to snowy weather and slippery road surfaces.
- Urban areas and daytime hours recorded higher accident rates due to dense traffic, unlike rural zones and nighttime hours.
- Area-wise casualty distribution can be explored through the interactive map chart in the dashboard.

## Tools Used
- Power BI – Visualization and dashboard development
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Custom measures and calculations
- Excel – Initial data preparation and cleaning
